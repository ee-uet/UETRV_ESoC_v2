## UETRV-ESoC-v2
UETRV-ECORE-v2 is a RISC-V based SoC derived from [UETRV_ESoC](https://github.com/ee-uet/UETRV_ESoC) with a few bug-fixes and increased memory sizes; it has been passed through the Cadence VLSI flow for submission to Google and Efabless' Open-MPW-8 shuttle using Skywater's 130 nm PDK. The verilog rtl used in this repo is generated from Scala source, available [here](https://github.com/ee-uet/UETRV_ESoC). Further details about the peripheral memory map, bootloader, example programs, testbenches etc. are also provided in that repo. The following are the differences between UETRV-ESoC and UETRV-ESoC-v2:
